    "## Introduction\n",
    "Cities are making more climate change policies, which is overall a good sign of progress. However, we should be critical of all policies and question 1) their effectiveness and 2) if the policy is creating unexpected consequences. For example, climate policies have the potential to both positively and negatively impact the economy and quality of life for residents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Living in London, I am interested in exploring the impact of the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) on real estate values in the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation: Anytime the government draws a boundary line and uses it to create spatial policy, it creates unintended externalities. The ULEZ was created and announced in April 2019  to \"reduce air pollutant emissions from road transport\" (Ma, et al, 2021). The ULEZ has been one of many policies that London has implemented with the aim to improve air quality in the capital. .\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been numerous academic studies to determine if the ULEZ and its relative, the LEZ have been effective as policy treatments for reducing urban emissions and improving air quality. Researchers have found there is a downward trend of air pollution over time and they did not find a significant impact by the ULEZ (Ma, et al, 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it possible that the ULEZ has impacted real estate values and home prices in recent sales? Spatial policies have the ability to make the areas they effect in the city either more or less desirable to live in. This study will determine if house prices, as a proxy for desirability and demand of houses, have increased inside the zone. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Academics in the social sciences and public health often evaluate if a policy has been an effective intervention and made the difference it was created to do. We can evaluate if a policy is effective by using causal inference techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Spatial Policies, we can consider the region and geography that the policy effects as the 'treatment' group, and the rest of the geography as a control group. This research question is inspired by a paper that compared house prices within school catchment districts of New York City (Rischard, et al., 2021), and that is how they framed their research. There are specific geographic boundaries that divide houses and streets into the districts, and given that schools fall on a ranking of desirability, the ability to live within the catchment area matters and house prices are impacted. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper found that there is a significant difference in house prices across several districts. They found one area in New York City where houses on the desirable side of the district line were on averge roughly 20% more than the houses on the less desirable side using Geographical Regression Discontinuity Design (GeoRDD). Of course, housing stock is hetergenious and one must acknowledge the differences and spatial variations of housing type and quality, no to mention community ammenities such as schools and high streets, that impact prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key part of these causal inference techniques are that the geographic boundary can be seen as arbitrary and assume (and prove) that the properties on either side are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Terms to use: exogenous factor, forcing variable, etc  \n",
    "\n",
    "-- perhaps define more RDD (from the Rischard paper)\n"
